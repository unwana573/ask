# 💕 Personal Love Letter Page

A romantic, scrapbook-style single-page website inspired by the uploaded design — perfect for sharing with someone special.

## Layout & Design
- **Scrapbook aesthetic**: Soft pink background with scattered heart decorations around the border, mimicking the handmade feel of the reference image
- **Textured paper look**: A cream/white inner area styled to look like a scrapbook page with slightly rough edges
- **Warm, romantic color palette**: Pinks, creams, soft reds, and white
